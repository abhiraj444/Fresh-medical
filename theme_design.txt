 the current yellow-orange background with white text (in light mode) and bright yellow in dark mode is visually fatiguing and not optimized for readability.

Here are improvements and tips for both Light Mode and Dark Mode, specifically for sections like "Reasoning" cards or blocks:

âœ… General UI/UX Tips
Aspect	What to Fix	What to Do Instead
Background Color	Harsh yellow is overwhelming	Use softer neutral tones (gray-blue, off-white, slate)
Font Contrast	Yellow on white/black lacks good readability	Use dark text on soft light backgrounds (and vice versa)
Box Design	No spacing feels cramped	Add inner padding, round corners, subtle shadow
Font Style	Uniform bolding reduces hierarchy	Use different font weights for titles/subsections
